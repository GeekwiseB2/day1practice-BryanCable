        <h3>It all started with a Foo Fighters concert.</h3>
        <p>I was having some pre-concert drinks and tacos across the street with
        some friends. I was getting a bit chatty and started talking about my
        desire to start learning to code and possibly enroll in one of the very
        expensive coding camps. One of the friends mentioned that the building
        he works in actually offers a few courses. A few days later I was on my
        Harley and headed to Bitwise!</p>
        <p>The moment I walked into the building I knew that Bitwise was a place
        that I wanted to be involved with. It was like nothing I had ever seen
        in the central valley before. I proceeded to follow the signs painted on
        the floor down the stairs and into Geekwise. This is where I happened upon
        Ryeker who, after telling me his story, convinced me that this is where
        I would begin me next path.</p>
        <p>After six weeks of Websites for Beginners I felt that I had a pretty
        good grasp on HTML and CSS structure and was ready for more. I am literally
        dreaming about code at this point. I am excited to learn more and am willing
        to put in the work to do so.</p>
