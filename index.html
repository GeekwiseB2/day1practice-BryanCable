        <h3>It all started with a Foo Fighters concert.</h3>
        <p>I was having some pre-concert drinks and tacos across the street with
        some friends. I was getting a bit chatty and started talking about my
        desire to start learning to code and possibly enroll in one of the very
        expensive coding camps. One of the friends mentioned that the building
        he works in actually offers a few courses. A few days later I was on my
        Harley and headed to Bitwise!</p>
